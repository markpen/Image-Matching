The version is optimized by further parallelized, and it is based on communication optimization and computation optimization.

Environment setup:
I did the project on the HPC server. All environment setup is the same as hw3.
1, firstly run command: "module load cuda/5.0".
2, secondly run command : " module load gcc/4.4.3".

How to use
1, Edit the main.cu file, change the value of 'srcFile' to the source image file name, and change value of 'smpFile' to the sample image file name.
2, use 'nvcc main.cu timer.c -o naive' to complie it(Assume you have load cuda/5.0 and gcc/4.4.3).
3, use 'qsub cuda.sh' to submit the job(here I use gpu2).
4, It will return a file named 'NC.o*', use 'less' command to see it.
5, The final result (x, y) represent the matched point of top left point of sample image in the source image.
